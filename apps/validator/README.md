# Application to validate video authenticity
Note: This example application code also serves as example code for how to implement the validation side of
the *Signed Video Framework*.

## Prerequisites
This application relies on GstAppSink (part of gStreamer) and signed-video-framework.
- [gStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=c)
- [signed-video-framework](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/signed-video-framework)

## Description
The application process NALU by NALU and validates the authenticity continuously. The result is
written on screen and in addition, a summary is written to the file *validation_results.txt*.

It is implemented as a GstAppSink that process every NALU and validates the authenticity on-the-fly.

## Building the validator application
Below are meson commands to build the validator application. First you need to have the signed-video-framework library installed.

Then build the validator application with meson as
```
meson -Dvalidator=true path/to/signed-video-framework-examples path/to/build/folder
meson install -C path/to/build/folder
```

### Example meson commands on Linux
These example commands assume the current directory is the parent directory of both signed-video-framework and signed-video-framework-examples.

Build and install the library locally in `./my_installs/`.
```
meson --prefix $PWD/my_installs signed-video-framework build_lib
meson install -C build_lib
```
Then build and install the `validator.exe` in the same place
```
meson --prefix $PWD/my_installs -Dvalidator=true signed-video-framework-examples build_apps
meson install -C build_apps
```
The executable is now located at `./my_installs/bin/validator.exe`

## Running
Validate an MP4 file of an H264 video using the app
```
./path/to/your/installed/validator.exe -c h264 signed_test_h264.mp4
```
With the example Linux commands above testing `signed_test_h264.mp4` in [test-files/](../../test-files/)
```
./my_installs/bin/validator.exe -c h264 signed-video-framework-examples/test-files/signed_test_h264.mp4
```

There are both signed and unsigned test files in [test-files/](../../test-files/) for both H264 and
H265.
